![Supported Python versions](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8%20and%20later-blue.svg)

My collection of plugins for [Limnoria](https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria).

## Installation
The recommended way of fetching plugins in this repository is to clone the git repository:

* `$ git clone https://github.com/jlu5/SupyPlugins`

and add the folder to your bot's `config directories.plugins`. Then, you can update your local copy of all plugins by running `git pull`.

**You will need a copy of [Limnoria](https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria) running on Python >= 3.8** (prefer the latest Python 3.x available).

You can also install individual plugins using pip: `pip3 install "git+https://github.com/jlu5/SupyPlugins.git#subdirectory=PLUGIN_NAME"`

## Support
Feel free to post to the issue tracker if you have any problems, or find me on the Limnoria discussion channel `#limnoria @ Libera.chat`.

## License
Unless otherwise noted, all plugins are available under a 3 clause BSD license (inserted at the top of each file).
